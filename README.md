# BIO
HI my name is Noah Lemmon and I am currently a senior at murray state university and am trying to get my BA in Computer Science. I plan on entering the IT field after I graduate and hope to continue and advance to a more respectable position. I really love any type of video game and I am a big fan for all things soccer.
